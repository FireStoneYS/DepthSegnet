# Depth-Segnet

## Segnet using RGBD images

> This is a example of segmentation done using Depth as an additional parameter.  
> Depth is converted into three fields : horizontal disparity, height above ground, and the angle the pixelâ€™s local surface  
normal makes with the inferred gravity direction.  
> This is explained in this paper (https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sgupta/pdf/rcnn-depth.pdf).

> This network takes as input a RGB+HHA image and starts training  
> Script to make a lmdb from RGB + HHA + Segmented mask file is provided  
> You can also download the converted lmdb from:  
> Data(RGB+HHA+ Segmented Masks) https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B9Zck1VQgjZObG8ySHBuR2JieDQ?usp=sharing  
> The modified prototxts are included in models as (segnet_depth)  
> NYUdv2 dataset was used for training  
> Follow the rest of instructions from  original Segnet.
